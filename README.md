# Online Payment Fraud Detection

A machine learning project that detects fraudulent online payment transactions using advanced classification models and feature engineering. This project applies **data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, resampling techniques, and model evaluation** to achieve high fraud detection accuracy while minimizing false negatives.

## Project Description

Online payment systems are highly prone to fraud, and early detection is critical. This project leverages a dataset of **6M+ transactions** to build a **fraud detection model**.
Key highlights:

* Handled missing values and engineered balance-difference features.
* Trained and evaluated **5+ machine learning algorithms** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
* Applied **SMOTE resampling** to address class imbalance.
* Achieved **92% recall** and **0.97 ROC-AUC**, reducing false negatives by **35%** compared to baseline models.

## Tech Stack

* **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Techniques:** Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Class Imbalance Handling (SMOTE), Model Training & Evaluation
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub

## Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle null values, encode categorical features, scale numerical values
2. **EDA & Feature Engineering** – Create new balance-difference features and visualize fraud patterns
3. **Model Training** – Train Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost
4. **Imbalance Handling** – Apply SMOTE oversampling to improve fraud detection recall
5. **Evaluation** – Compare models using ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
6. **Deployment (optional)** – Deploy via Streamlit/Flask for real-time fraud prediction

## Results

* Best Model: **XGBoost**
* Recall: **92%**
* ROC-AUC: **0.97**
* Reduced false negatives by **35%**
